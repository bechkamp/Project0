Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This is my First Assignment for the Course CS50 by Harvard University
I am going to make my own Website. I will design a personal webpage about myself, one of my interests which is Football. The website will meet the following requirements:
            - It will contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
            - The website will include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
            - The Website will have at least one stylesheet file.
            - The stylesheet will use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
            - The stylesheet(s) will include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
            - I will use Bootstrap on my website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
            - The stylesheets will use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
